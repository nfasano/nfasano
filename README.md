### About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate studying applied physics at Princeton University, graduating in May, and actively seeking new career opportunities in data science or quantitative research. I am excited by the prospect of uncovering new insights from vast amounts of data, a skill I developed in the last 5+ years by curating and analyzing massive datasets about light-matter interactions. I am ready to bring my extensive research experience to a mission-driven company where I can apply my technical skills to solve challenging problems.

### Dissertation Research Projects: 
[Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X9sdXuQAAAAJ&hl=en)

My dissertation research focused on high-intensity light-matter interactions, where I combined large experimental and numerical datasets to engineer the next generation of short-wavelength, high-power light sources. 

Main Thesis Contributions:
- Led an experimental campaign on Princeton's 20TW laser system, which demonstrated waveform-controlled harmonic generation using a novel experimental technique (a multi-pass plasma mirror configuration), resulting in two conference presentations and a written manuscript
- Curated and analyzed terabyte-scale simulation data to show that plasma mirrors are a practical choice for synthesizing and controlling the fundamental properties of intense light sources
- Collaborated with research teams from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the University of Michigan (CUOS group), where I co-designed and executed experiments

### Data Science Personal Projects:
- **Sentiment Analysis Classifier on black lives matter tweets** (Github Repo)
    - Project Description: Given a dataset of xx tweets, some of which I labelled, I built a sentiment analysis classifier to determine wheter a given tweet was . This work was completed as a course project for COS xxx at Princeton University.
    - Skills Demonstrated: Python, sentiment analysis, NLP, classification models and evaluation metrics, imbalanced datasets
- **Predicting Fragile Family Outcomes** (Github Repo)
    - Project Description:
    - Skills Demonstrated: 
- **Movie Recommendation System -- (In progress)** (Github Repo)
    - Project Description:
    - Skills Demonstrated: Webscraping (beautifulSoup, selenium), NLP, Latent Dirichlet Allocation,

### Other Coding Projects:
- **Bash script for executing code through the Slurm scheduler** - (Github Repo)
    - Description: Wrote a bash script that submits batches of simulations through the Slurm scheduler (a commonly used cluster management and job scheduling system for Linux clusters), where each simulation can have different parameters and requested computational resources. This script provides an organized framework for managing massively parallel simulations and terabyte-scale datasets and has been adopted by successive graduate students who use the computing cluster in a myriad of ways.
    - Skills learned: Linux shell scripting, High performance computing 

- **Shopping List in Google sheets** - [Try it Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JmDtCFYWc8K8Y4g38fVQvjgUsC7UjRVS25mL4au47Pw/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Description: Created a shopping list which automatically arranges selected items in the order that one walks through the store, making my shopping trips more efficient. Features include crossing off items with checkboxes, removing checked items, all items, or a single item by clicking a checkbox. Convenient addition of items using a searchable dropdown list. Future features will include pricing an aisle information from webscraped data and the ability to add entire recipes with one click.
    - Skills learned: google sheets, JavaScript programming 

<!-- - **Ray tracing renderer ** - (Github Repo)
    - Description: Following the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" series by Peter Shirley, I implemented a functioning ray tracing algorithm capable of rendering spheres, boxes, triangles with the option for different textures.
    - Skills learned: C++, object oriented programming -->

### More about me (Fun/Miscellaneous):
- I am a home cook who loves experimenting with new recipes and flavors from all cuisines
- I am passionate about the art of photography, both for the journey of capturing the photo and for the story that the photo tells

<!-- - âš¡ Fun fact about me: I made a grand entrance into the world by being born "en caul", a condition where a baby is delivered inside a fully intact amniotic sac. According to some cultures, this is considered a sign of good luck and it's also believed that babies born en caul are incapable of drowning. So, let's just say I'm a lucky and unsinkable little bundle of joy!"
