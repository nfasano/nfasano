### About me
I am in my final year as an applied physics PhD candidate at Princeton Univeristy and currently looking for career opportunities as a data scientist. I am passionate abut using large datsets to drive data-informed decisions, a skill I have largely developed over 5+ years by using terbyte-scale datasets to uncover new physical insights into high-power light-matter interactions as well as propose future experimental campaigns. More recently, I have rounded out my data science skillset through a combination of personal data science projects and online courses. 

This page is dedicated to my datscience portfolio. See my resume and LinkedIn profile linked above for more about my work experience and qualifications.

### Data Science Personal Projects:
- **Sentiment Analysis Classifier on black lives matter tweets** (Github Repo)
    - Project Description: Given a dataset of xx tweets, some of which I labelled, I built a sentiment analysis classifier to determine wheter a given tweet was . This work was completed as a course project for COS xxx at Princeton University.
    - Skills Demonstrated: Sentiment analysis, NLP, Python programming, classification models and evaluating metrics
- **Predicting Fragile Family Outcomes** (Github Repo)
    - Project Description:
    - Skills Demonstrated: 
- **Movie Recommendation System** (Github Repo)

### Other Coding Projects:
- **Shopping List in Google sheets** - [Try it Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JmDtCFYWc8K8Y4g38fVQvjgUsC7UjRVS25mL4au47Pw/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Description: Created a shopping list which automatically arranges selected items in the order that I walk the store, making my shopping trips more efficient. Features include crossing off items with checkboxes, removing checked, all, or a single item by clicking a checkbox. Convenient addition of items using a searchable dropdown list. Future features will include pricing an aisle information from webscraped data and the ability to add entire recipes with one click.
    - Skills learned: google sheets, JavaScript programming

### Relevant Course Work:
#### Princeton University (Graduate Level Courses):
- **ELE 535: Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition** - A variety of classical and recent results in theoretical machine learning and statistical analysis were discussed, including: Bayesian classification, regression, regularization, SVD, PCA, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks and gradient descent.
- **COS 524: Fundamentals of Machine Learning** (audited - no credit given, but see completed projects above) - This course focused on useful approaches to analyzing large complex data sets, exploring both theoretical foundations and practical applications of machine learning. Course covered classification, regression, clustering, dimension reduction (PCA, SVD, NNMF, LDA) and time series models.
- **MAE 501: Mathematical Methods of Engineering Analysis I** - Covered mathematical topics in linear algebra, matrices, eigenvalue problems, and ordinary and partial differential equations.
