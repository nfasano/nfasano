### About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate studying applied physics at Princeton University, graduating in May and actively seeking new career opportunities as a data scientist. I am excited by the challenge of uncovering insights from vast amounts of data, a skill I have developed in the last 5+ years by curating and analyzing terabyte-scale datasets pertaining to high-power light-matter interactions. More recently, I have rounded out my data science skillset through personal projects and formal course work. I am excited to bring my experience to a mission-driven company, where I can apply my technical skills to drive meaningful change.

### Relevant Course Work:
#### Princeton University (Graduate Level Courses):
- **ELE 535: Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition** - A variety of classical and recent results in theoretical machine learning and statistical analysis were discussed, including: Bayesian classification, regression, regularization, SVD, PCA, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks and gradient descent.
- **COS 524: Fundamentals of Machine Learning** (audited - no credit given, but see completed projects above) - This course focused on useful approaches to analyzing large complex data sets, exploring both theoretical foundations and practical applications of machine learning. Course covered classification, regression, clustering, dimension reduction (PCA, SVD, NNMF, LDA) and time series models.

### More about me (Fun/Miscellaneous):
- I am a home cook who loves experimenting with new recipes and flavors from all cuisines
- I am passionate about the art of photography, both for the journey of capturing the photo and for the story that the photo tells
- Playing guitar is a hobby that brings me joy through self-expression and relaxation

<!-- - âš¡ Fun fact about me: I made a grand entrance into the world by being born "en caul", a condition where a baby is delivered inside a fully intact amniotic sac. According to some cultures, this is considered a sign of good luck and it's also believed that babies born en caul are incapable of drowning. So, let's just say I'm a lucky and unsinkable little bundle of joy!"
